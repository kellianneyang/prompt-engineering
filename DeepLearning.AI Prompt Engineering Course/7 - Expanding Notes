# Expanding

Definition
- Taking a shorter piece of text and having the LLM make it longer

Notes
- Any text generated by AI should be signed as such

Example
- Given a customer review, get the model to write a reply
- Can base reply text on sentiment of review
- Model can be instructed to:
    - Tone: "Write in a concise and professional tone"
    - Personalization: "Use specific details from the review"
    - Different replies: "Do X if sentiment is positive or neutral; if sentiment is negative, do Y"
    - Sign off: "Sign the email as 'AI Customer Agent'"

Temperature
- A parameter of an LLM
- Changes the variety of the model's responses; degree of exploration or randomness of the model
- A higher temperature setting will make the model choose less likely next words when generating a response
- Tasks
    - For reliability and predictability in the model, use temperature = 0
        - With 0, whenever the model gets the exact same prompt it will give the exact same completion
    - For variety and creativity, use higher temperature (e.g., 0.3, 0.5)
