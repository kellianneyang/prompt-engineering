# Iterative Prompt Development

Cycle:
- Idea ->
- Implementation (Prompt) ->
- Experimental Result ->
- Error Analysis ->
- Repeat

Guidelines:
- Try something (be clear and specific)
- Analyze why result does not give desired output
- Clarify instructions, give more time to think
- Refine the idea and the prompt
- Try the prompt with a batch of examples
- Repeat

Length of response:
- If giving the instruction to output a certain length, check the length of the response (LLMs don't always follow instructions exactly).
- Can try various ways to limit length:
    - "Use at most 50 words."
    - "Use 3 sentences."
    - "Use at most 280 characters."
- Because LLMs use tokenizers, they don't always get lengths correct

Consider prompt modifications like:
- Length of response
- Audience (change tone or details to use based on who will use the output)
- Specify details you want it to always include
- The format the output should take (HTML, JSON; check that the output is correct in its format)
